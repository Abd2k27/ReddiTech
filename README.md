# REDDITECH

## DESCRIPTION

> As part of this project, you will take on the role of a Software Architect.

> You are asked to create an application (mobile or desktop) using the Reddit API.

> You must create a browsing application with these features:
- Authenticate to the Reddit API with the OAuth2 protocol
- Display the user’s profile
- Display posts from the subreddits the user is subbed to
- Filter the posts (ie. best, hot, new, top, random, . . . )
- Search for subreddits
- Display a subreddit basic information (Number of subscribers, description, header image, . . . )
- Display posts from a subreddit (You still must be able to filter the posts as mentioned above)
- Subscribe/Unsubscribe to a subreddit
- Display at least 6 of the user’s settings
- Be able to update at least 6 of the user’s settings

## PREREQUISITES
What do you need to install ?
```bash
$ npm
$ nodejs (14.x)
$ expo (React Native)
```

The Expo App will load the JS bundle and allow you to test the project without deploying it or building it with `Android Studio` or `XCode`

You can download it here:
- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

## HOW TO BUILD
Clone and go into the directory.
Then,
```bash
$ yarn `or` npm install
```

After that,
```bash
$ expo start
```
Then, open your expo app and scan the QR code. You will see the app loading in your phone.

You can also run it with your emulator. After doing `expo start`, it will open your emulator if you have one. Get a look at [Emulator Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator?gclid=Cj0KCQjwnoqLBhD4ARIsAL5JedKglZv67H7Cwa77CBUejY7b7j0Ln6WNirrG2DI804crRhdhWIfMVr4aAqOJEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
